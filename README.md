# Portfolio Site

I'm Nick MacKenzie, a Full Stack Developer who completed the Software Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly. This site showcases my projects and provides a platform for me to share my thoughts through a blog. A goal of mine was to utilize NextJS SEO features to the best of my ability.

## Technologies Used

I built this site using Next.js 13, a powerful React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation. To personalize the appearance of the site, I utilized custom CSS styles.

## Features

2. **Blog: (Coming Soon)** I want share my thoughts and insights through the integrated blog.

3. **Custom Design:** I wanted this site to reflect my creativity and attention to detail, so I created a unique and personalized design using custom CSS.
